I am **Vedant Kalbande**, a final year MS student at [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in), IIT Bombay, working with [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa). My research focuses on microarchitecture, specifically optimising processor front-end architecture for data centre applications.

Join me on this exciting academic journey through my website. Discover the innovative work of our research group [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io) and stay updated on my latest projects in computer science. Besides academics, I enjoy cricket and badminton, adding a unique balance to my life.

Let's explore the mysteries of computer systems and microarchitecture together. Stay tuned for updates on my latest projects and insights into the world of computer science.
