I am **Vedant Kalbande**, a driven first-year MS student enrolled in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at IIT Bombay. Under the guidance of the esteemed [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa), I'm excitedly exploring the world of micro-architecture.

Having completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Government College of Engineering, Amravati, in June 2023, I discovered my passion for research. Currently, my academic focus revolves around microarchitecture for data center workloads.

Here at my website, I invite you to embark on this exciting academic journey with me. Explore our [Research group's](https://casper-iitb.github.io) work at the cutting edge of computer science and learn more about the groundbreaking projects and discoveries that we're involved in. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have diverse interests, including cricket and table tennis, which add a unique dimension to my life.

Let's explore the mysteries of computer systems and microarchitecture together. Stay tuned for updates on my latest projects and insights into the world of computer science.
